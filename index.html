        <p>
            Alex is the name and programming is the game. Let's get to know me quick and dirty. I'm a coding
            connoisseur, a tech enthusiast, and a problem-solving wizard.
        </p>
        <p>
            But don't let the binary digits fool you; I'm not all 1s and 0s. I'm a human behind the code, fueled
            by coffee, curiosity, and a passion for innovation. I was born and raised in sunny Santa Barbara.
            Here I met and made personal connections with friends and colleagues. Along my way I picked up
            several <a href="#hobbies">hobbies</a> including hiking, swimming, cars, music, coding, digital art,
            and 3D printing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have completed my <a href="#education">education</a> background starting in my hometown gaining my
            first exposure to various subjects in Santa Barbara City College. It was there that I got my first
            taste of both computer science and bio/chemistry. I obtained my Bachelor in Biochemistry under the
            Chemistry department at University of California Santa Barbara. Working throughout all of my years
            of high school and college career I have acquired a number of skills. Also, I love bees.

                <p>
                    I have been interested in coding since a young age when I was able to get my hands on
                    technology. I began my programming experience in high school where I began to understand the
                    limitlessness of code. I now have many <a href="#projects">projects</a> that show my variety of
                    skills.

                    TrainEzPy is a simple script program that helps setup and train an object detection model. This
                    currently works for specifically Pascal Voc formated bounding boxes for exactly one classification.
                    While detecting multiple classes would be fairly easy to add in this program (perhaps in the
                    future), the point is to make it easy to quickly and effectively make a simple model. I made this
                    for my much larger project involving machine learning down below.

            As mentioned in my about section, I didn't go far for my education. After high school I attended the "number
            one community college in the nation"; Santa Barbara City College. There I reinforced my general knowledge
            and tested the waters of various majors. I went from Biology to Accounting/Economics to Chemistry and to
            Computer Science. In the end, upon my transfer, I was forced to make a choice and went with biochemistry.
            Biochemistry became my major at UCSB (University of California Santa Barbara).
        </p>
        <p>
            The University of California Santa Barbara provided me with an absolutely wonderful education. While
            attending the university I kept my computer science knowledge up with occasional reads and projects. This
            stragety helped propel me to my next school for an advance degree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bioinformatics was my next conquest. I am set to complete my Masters of Science at Brandeis University in
            March of 2024. This degree has refound my appreciation and curiosity of machine learning, data analysis, and
            coding as whole. It has propelled me to my decision to push for a more software/programming oriented career.
