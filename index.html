                Alex is the name and programming is the game. Let's get to know me quick and dirty. I'm a coding
                connoisseur, a tech enthusiast, and a problem-solving wizard.</p>
            <p>
                But don't let the binary digits fool you; I'm not all 1s and 0s. I'm a human behind the code, fueled by
                coffee, curiosity, and a passion for innovation. I was born and raised in sunny Santa Barbara. Here I
                met and made personal connections with friends and colleagues. Along my way I picked up several <a
                    href="#hobbies">hobbies</a> including hiking, swimming, cars, music, coding, digital art, and 3D
                printing.</p>
            <p>
                I have completed my <a href="#education">education</a> background starting in my hometown. Gaining my
                first exposure to various subjects in Santa Barbara City College. It was there that I got my first taste
                of both computer science and bio/chemistry. I obtained my Bachelor in Biochemistry under the Chemistry
                department at University of California Santa Barbara. Working throughout all of my years of high school
                and college career I have acquired a number of skills.</p>

                <span class="bold-highlight">Coding:</span> I have been interested in coding since a fairly small age
                when I was able to get my hands on technology. I began my programming experience in high school where I
                began to understand the limitlessness of code. I now have many <a href="#projects">projects</a> that
                show my variety of skills.
