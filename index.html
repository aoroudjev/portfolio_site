            Alex is the name and programming is the game. Let's get to know me quick and dirty. I'm a coding
            connoisseur, a tech enthusiast, and a problem-solving wizard.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a dedicated professional with a human touch, my journey in technology is driven by a blend of enthusiasm
            for learning, a relentless pursuit of innovation, and a deep-seated passion for problem-solving. I was born
            and raised in sunny Santa Barbara. Here I met and made personal connections with friends and colleagues.
            Along my way I picked up several <a href="#hobbies">hobbies</a> including hiking, swimming, cars, music,
            coding, digital art, and 3D printing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have completed my <a href="#education">education</a> background starting in my hometown gaining my
            first exposure to various subjects in Santa Barbara City College. It was there that I got my first
            taste of both computer science and bio/chemistry. I obtained my Bachelor in Biochemistry under the
            Chemistry department at University of California Santa Barbara. Working throughout all of my years
            of high school and college career I have acquired a number of skills.

                <p>
                    I've had a passion for coding from a young age, seizing every opportunity to engage with technology.
                    My journey into programming commenced during high school, opening my eyes to the boundless
                    possibilities of code. Over the years, I've accumulated a diverse portfolio of <a href="#projects">projects</a>

                    One of my passions lies in the realm of the fine arts. While I wouldn't claim to be a masterful
                    artist, my journey in this field has endowed me with both a solid understanding and a deep
                    appreciation for the arts. I typically keep my work private, as it's primarily a personal pursuit,
                    but you can explore some of my creations in my <a

                <p>
                    I also have a keen interest in 3D printing. Although I'm relatively new to this field, I've already
                    had the opportunity to craft simple yet functional pieces. I've found various applications for my
                    3D-printed creations, using them for miniature models, repairing and enhancing existing components,
                    and even constructing autonomous structures from scratch. This exciting journey into 3D printing has
                    opened up a world of creative possibilities for me. I am planning on making this a part of my next
                    coding project.</p>

                    PalmPaths_v2 is a multiplatform application that I am currently developing. The aim of this
                    application is to use a combination of machine learning, computer vision, and data manipulation to
                    produce a 'reading' of the palm lines. This was initially built using just Kotlin for android
                    devices which I then ported to be a Flutter application for multiplatform use. This will showcase a
                    self-developed algorithm for extracting palm lines from a palm regardless of various palm
                    differences.

                    TrainEzPy is a module made up of a simple set of functions that helps setup and train an object
                    detection model. This currently works for specifically Pascal Voc formatted bounding boxes for
                    exactly one classification. While detecting multiple classes would be fairly easy to add in this
                    program (perhaps in the future), the point is to make it easy to quickly and effectively make a
                    simple model. I made this for my much larger project involving machine learning down below.

                    ReactSweeper is a simple minesweeper game I built to learn a bit of TypeScript and the new

                    allowed me to learn more about web development and design. Not much else to say about this one.

            In my "About" section, I've mentioned that my educational journey didn't take me far from home. Following
            high school, I enrolled in Santa Barbara City College, often regarded as the top community college in the
            nation. During my time there, I explored various academic avenues, transitioning from Biology to
            Accounting/Economics, Chemistry, and eventually settling on Biochemistry when I transferred to the
            University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).
        </p>
        <p>
            UCSB provided me with an exceptional education, and I managed to keep my computer science skills sharp
            through intermittent reading and personal projects. This strategy would prove invaluable in my pursuit of
            advanced education.
        </p>
        <p>
            My next academic venture led me into the world of Bioinformatics. I graduated top of the class with my Master
            of Science degree at Brandeis University in March 2024. This experience has reignited my passion for machine
            learning, data analysis, and coding as a whole, prompting me to pursue a career more focused on programming.
