            Alex is the name and programming is the game. Let's get to know me quick and dirty. I'm a coding
            connoisseur, a tech enthusiast, and a problem-solving wizard.</p>
        <p>
            But don't let the binary digits fool you; I'm not all 1s and 0s. I'm a human behind the code, fueled
            by coffee, curiosity, and a passion for innovation. I was born and raised in sunny Santa Barbara.
            Here I met and made personal connections with friends and colleagues. Along my way I picked up
            several <a href="#hobbies">hobbies</a> including hiking, swimming, cars, music, coding, digital art,
            and 3D printing.</p>
        <p>
            I have completed my <a href="#education">education</a> background starting in my hometown gaining my
            first exposure to various subjects in Santa Barbara City College. It was there that I got my first
            taste of both computer science and bio/chemistry. I obtained my Bachelor in Biochemistry under the
            Chemistry department at University of California Santa Barbara. Working throughout all of my years
            of high school and college career I have acquired a number of skills.</p>

                <h3>Coding: </h3>
                I have been interested in coding since a fairly
                small age when I was able to get my hands on technology. I began my programming experience in
                high school where I began to understand the limitlessness of code. I now have many <a

                One of my interests lays within the art
                department. While I do not consider myself an exemplary artist, I think my experience at thsi
                point has left me with not only robust knowledge but also appreciation of the fine arts. I do
                not showcase my work usually as it is generally used for my own personal interests but you can
                find some of my media on my <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dp3m5zsZJinoND2U7">photos
